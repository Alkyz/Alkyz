### Greetings! My name is Mario. 👋

I am an undergraduate student that has a passion for building back and front-end services. Very recently, I also have started learning the ropes of mobile app development. I love to create applications because I believe every app is made different and unique. Even with a whole world of software at our finger tips, there is always some new feature to develop, and that motivates me to think of new ideas. 💡

On this page, you can find some of my new and past works. Hope you enjoy. 👍
