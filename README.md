### Greetings! My name is Mario. 👋  
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hqU2KkjW5bE2v2Z7Q2/giphy.gif" width="250" height="250"/>

I am an undergraduate student that has a passion for building front and back-end services. Very recently, I also have started learning the ropes of mobile app development. I love to create applications because I believe every app is made different and unique. Even with a whole world of software at our finger tips, there is always some new feature to develop, and that motivates me to think of new ideas. 

On this page, you can find some of my new and past works. Hope you enjoy.
